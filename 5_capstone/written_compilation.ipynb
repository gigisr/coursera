If I had left them in then it would have skewed my results with the overwhelming bias towards there being no deaths, ever, but a high accuracy rate on the model. The other filtering factor I have used is the state entry for each row. I have removed any values that are not one of the 50 states, removing entries that are general areas such as Atlantic North.\n",
